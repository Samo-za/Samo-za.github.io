# My first webpage 

This is the first webpage I made using html, css & javascript.

To run my Application, you can clone my project and simply open index.html as it does not uses any server side language but it only uses markups and stylesheet.

Or just simply go to [live page](https://samo-za.github.io/).

> This site was built using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
